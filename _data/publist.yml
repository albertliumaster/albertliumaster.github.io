  description: The superconducting gap in high-Tc cuprates is known to exhibit spatial inhomogeneity. It is unknown however, how disorder of the superconducting gap translates to disorder of the superconducting phase. To address this question we developed 2-D terahertz spectroscopy in a non-collinear geometry for the first time, allowing us to study interlayer tunneling nonlinearities in single-crystal LSCO.

  description: The spectral density of exciton-phonon coupling is a quantity that is difficult to measure directly. We apply 2-D spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures to resolve the spectral density in CdSe colloidal quantum dots, which in turn reveals confined vibrational modes from the nanometer-size dot geometry.
