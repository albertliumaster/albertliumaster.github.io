- title: "Probing Inhomogeneous Cuprate Superconductivity by Terahertz Josephson Echo Spectroscopy"
  image: MDTS.png
  description: The superconducting gap in high-Tc cuprates is known to exhibit spatial inhomogeneity. It is unknown however, how disorder of the superconducting gap translates to disorder of the superconducting phase. To address this question we developed 2-D terahertz spectroscopy in a non-collinear geometry for the first time, allowing us to study interlayer tunneling nonlinearities in single-crystal LSCO.

  image: YTOMagnetism.jpeg
  description: YTiO3 is a low-temperature ferromagnet in which orbital fluctuations lower the Curie temperature. Here, we used a strong-field terahertz light field to resonantly excite a vibrational mode that results in a remarkable threefold increase in the Curie temperature. This effect is attributed to a light-induced suppression of orbital fluctuations that manifests as metastable ferromagnetism persisting for nanoseconds.

- title: "Towards Engineering Intrinsic Linewidths and Line-Broadening in Perovskite Nanoplatelets"
  image: 2021_ACSNanoGraphic.png
  description: Colloidal nanoplatelets are often claimed to be homogeneously broadened due to the dominant out-of-plane quantum confinement. To validate this claim we use 2-D spectroscopy to simultaneously resolve homogeneous and inhomogeneous exciton linewidths in CsPbI3 perovskite nanoplatelets. These linewidths are resolved as a function of temperature, excitation power, and exciton resonance energy to provide design criteria for engineering optoelectronic properties for applications.

  image: TripletCoherence_compressed.png
  description: The exciton manifold in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals is claimed to host "bright-triplet" excitons that contribute to their remarkable luminescence efficiencies. However, signatures of these bright-triplet excitons are normally obscured by dominant inhomogeneous broadening. To circumvent this issue, we use polarization-resolved 2-D spectroscopy to extract the intrinsic exciton lineshape in an ensemble and find evidence of an interleaved "partially-bright" exciton manifold.

We apply 2-D spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures to resolve the spectral density in CdSe colloidal quantum dots, which in turn reveals confined vibrational modes from the nanometer-size dot geometry.
