# Research

<p align="justify">
Our overarching goal is to discover and understand phenomena in <b>quantum matter</b>. We broadly define quantum matter as systems in which quantum effects play a primary role in determining their properties, which range from materials with strong electronic correlations to objects with nanometer length scale dimensions, at which quantum confinement effects manifest.
</p>

<p align="justify">
We are specifically interested in the interaction of quantum matter with strong light fields, the regime of <b>nonlinear optics</b>. In this regime many new possibilities emerge, such as nonlinear spectroscopies and driving materials out of thermal equilibrium.
</p>

Here are some techniques and themes that we currently work on:

**Technique: Multidimensional optical spectroscopy.** Multidimensional optical spectroscopy may be considered the most general nonlinear spectroscopic technique, which involves exciting a material with multiple ultrashort pulses of light and measuring a nonlinear observable. Compared to most nonlinear spectroscopies, which measure a projection or cross-section of a multidimensional optical response, multidimensional optical spectroscopy is capable of measuring nonlinear optical responses along all of their characteristic axes. One can

**Theme: Artificial atoms.** The Bohr model of the atom introduced the concept of discrete electronic energy levels. Today, we can replicate these discrete excitation spectra in solid-state materials for technological applications, but disorder and interactions with the lattice environment (phonons) complicate the physics tremendously. Defect vacancy centers and colloidal nanocrystals are examples of such systems that we have studied using multidimensional spectroscopy [1,2,3,4], yielding much new insight into these "artificial atoms".

**Technique: Multidimensional terahertz spectroscopy.** One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Theme: Layered superconductors.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Theme: Fluctuating ferromagnets and ferroelectrics.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

**Technique: Mode-selective phonon pumping.** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.
